---Wayne Choi's Clicker (wkchoi)---
This is a clicker application. This allows you create clickers. From there
you can increment, zero, rename, delete, and view click history.

From the main activity page there is a is a button that allows you to 
create a clicker. Right beside the button there is a field that allow you
to give a name to your clicker. There is a max of 10 characters. Below there 
will be a list of Clickers created.

When you click on one of your clicker a new activity will appear. In this area 
you are able to increment the counter with the plus button. Below that
there is a reset counter button that will set your counter back to zero. The 
View Clicker History button allow you to see statistics on your clicker. 
Rename will rename your clicker and Delete will delete our clicker.
